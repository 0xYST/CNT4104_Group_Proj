# Team Networking project 
In this project our team will create a front end and back end and use an API to return data to the front end to give the user interesting metadata.
We will deploy the project with docker to show that we understand scaling and working with containers and API calls on a server.

# Things To Do First:
- Base our tech stack
- Base documentation (Proof of concept / Overall goals)
- Team GPP Guidelines set up


# Sprint 1 Goals:
- Submit a jpg or other image file showing the eventual plan
- Not all menu's working or color scheme but the basic homepage is setup (but links not working)
- Should display at least the homepage
- You can just provide a URL if online or a screenshot with the URL shown in the browser
- Other pages as possible
- Basically a complete CSS with the homepage working well (and other's inheriting) is great
- A Basic Homepage but several others setup (but not pretty) is also good
- Depends on plan
