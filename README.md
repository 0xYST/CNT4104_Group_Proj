# Team Networking project 
In this project our team will create a front end and back end and use an API to return data to the front end to give the user interesting metadata.
We will deploy the project with docker to show that we understand scaling and working with containers and API calls on a server.

# Goals:
-	Give the user the ability to query with our interface
-	Create a good architecture for calling to the back end and getting it to display in the front end
-	Creating custom docker images for our front and back end 
-	Getting our containers to communicate with one another 
-	Learning how to implement very basic distributed systems with our containers 

# Relation to Networking:
Working with the Spotify REST API to understand http queries and understanding how to deploy projects with docker where our users can use their web browser to access our web-based software. Docker can also be a gateway to understanding load balancing with distributed systems which is an important concept for understanding scalability and network load.

# Group Roles:
- Jordan – Docker deployment and project management
- Chance – Front end UX/UI design
- Jason – Back end and API integration


# Things To Do First:
- Base our tech stack
- Base documentation (Proof of concept / Overall goals)
- Team GPP Guidelines set up


# Sprint 1 Goals:
- Submit a jpg or other image file showing the eventual plan
- Not all menu's working or color scheme but the basic homepage is setup (but links not working)
- Should display at least the homepage
- You can just provide a URL if online or a screenshot with the URL shown in the browser
- Other pages as possible
- Basically a complete CSS with the homepage working well (and other's inheriting) is great
- A Basic Homepage but several others setup (but not pretty) is also good
- Depends on plan
