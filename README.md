# CNT4104_Group_Proj
In this project our team will create a front end and back end and use an API to return data to the front end to give the user interesting metadata.
We will deploy the project with docker to show that we understand scaling and working with containers and API calls on a server.

API ideas:
- Youtube
- Spotify
- Weather
